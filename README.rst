Hanzi Stats
-----------

This Anki add-on calculates the number of Hanzi (simplified only) that you have learned so far: 

  - New HSKã€€levels
  - 6000 most frequently used characters (divided into 12 categories) 

To install put ``Hanzi_Stats.py`` into the ``addons`` folder in your Anki folder.

This is a modified version of the Anki Hanzi Stats plugin found at:

https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/296672579

It was originally written by Ben Lickly based on Japanese Stats by Damien Elmes.  Wordlist is based on the one used in the Anki 1.x plugin: Hanzi_Stats_New_HSK_20110411__show_all_hanzi__6000_chars.

This version includes small modifications by Trevor L. Davis to fix some typos and get rid of the HSK A, HSK B, HSK E, and HSK I categories (whatever they were).  The New HSK character lists has been updated from the 2010 version to the 2012 version.  The 6000 most frequently characters have been replaced by the list created by Dr. Sharoff.  Also clicking character links now sends you to hanzicraft.com instead of dict.cn.

The plugin is available under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later;  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
