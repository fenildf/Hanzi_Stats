This Anki add-on calculates the number of Hanzi (simplified only) that you have learned so far: 

  - 6000 most frequently used characters (divided into 12 categories) 
  - New HSKã€€levels

To install put ``Hanzi_Stats.py`` into the ``addons`` folder in your Anki folder.

This is a modified version of the Anki Hanzi Stats plugin found at:

https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/296672579

It was originally written by Ben Lickly based on Japanese Stats by Damien Elmes.  Wordlist is based on the one used in the Anki 1.x plugin: Hanzi_Stats_New_HSK_20110411__show_all_hanzi__6000_chars.

This version includes small modifications by Trevor L. Davis to fix some typos and get rid of the HSK A, HSK B, HSK E, and HSK I categories (whatever they were).  Also clicking character links now sends you to characterpop.com instead of dict.cn.

The plugin is available under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later;  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
